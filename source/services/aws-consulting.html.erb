    <h1>AWS Consulting - Your head start with the world's most powerful cloud computing platform.</h1>
    <p>The world of cloud computing isn't as daunting as it may seem. But getting it right is no stroll in the park either.</p>
    <p>Even the best software is worthless without the foundation of a solid infrastructure.</p>
    <p>We work alongside your developers, ensuring the best platform to scale your software.</p>

    <h2>The revolution of cloud hosting providers</h2>
    <p>When Amazon launched their AWS platform, it featured only a handful of services.</p>
    <p>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offered the infrastructure to spin up servers on demand.</p>
    <p>Relation Data Store (RDS) allowed developers to provision a managed SQL database at the click of a button.</p>
    <p>Simple Storage Service (S3) provided a cheap and easy way to store terabytes of objects.</p>
    <p>Route53 took care of DNS.</p>
    <p>Everything you needed to replace your traditional dedicated server or VPS.</p>
    <p>Traditionally you could wait hours (even days) for your service to provision. AWS introduced on-demand self-provisioning for everybody.</p>

    <h2>Serverless infrastructure, Alexa, machine learning &amp; more...</h2>
    <p>The number of services offered on AWS has grown rapidly in recent years. There are now a vast number of services, eclipsing the initial basic web hosting services.</p>
    <p>With every innovation comes new technology. The release of the Amazon Echo saw Alexa introduced to AWS. Alexa allows for speech recognition and synthesis via a simple software integration.</p>

    <h2>What is embedded software development?</h2>
    <p><strong>Embedded system design</strong> is present in many industries. It has been growing in popularity alongside the rise of IoT (the Internet of Things).
    <p>Embedded software development involves taking traditional hardware engineering and adding software to the project. This enables the device to process data and integrate with other services.</p>
    <p>This data is often used to enhance user experience and to drive further sales. Additionally, the ability to communicate with other devices around the home can prove useful.</p>
    <p>Such devices can be found within many household appliances and the automotive industry. We are also seeing an introduction into sport for both user convenience and safety.</p>
    <p>Computing power continues to increase whilst cost and size falls. Embedded systems programming becomes more popular in our homes as this trend continues. In some cases, it is already a necessity.</p>
    <p>New solutions emerge daily, aiming to improve the lives and wellbeing of humans. The environment also reaps the benefits with a number of high profile products such as the Nest thermostat. We're proud to be involved in these pioneering tools.</p>

    <h2>Embedded systems design &amp; development</h2>
    <p>We use <%= link_to 'Elixir', '/services/elixir-phoenix/' %> to code complex integrations. Suited to both traditional serial comms (such as RS232/RS485) and modern TCP/IP protocols.</p>
    <p>Elixir is based on Erlang, originally used to process telecommunications data across switchboards. It provides a quality foundation for processing large amounts of data in a fast and reliable fashion. This makes it ideal for use in embedded software development.</p>
    <p>We're working with <%= link_to 'European Golf Machinery', '/case-studies/european-golf-machinery/' %>, to modernise their driving range ball dispensers. Our software, hosted on Raspberry Pi, translates bit-data into a RESTful HTTP interface. This has opened their product up to integrations within the web application market. As a result, their customer base has seen steady growth since release.</p>
    <p>For more delicate hardware requirements, we turn to Arduino. We've prototyped many products with the Arduino Uno and the wearable Lilypad. </p>
    <p>We can assist throughout the entire project-phase. From specification and design to prototyping, development and high-volume custom PCB production. And it doesn't end there! We'll be on hand to help market and grow your product post-launch.</p>

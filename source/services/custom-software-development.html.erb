    <h2>Software development outsourcing</h2>
    <p>As entrepreneurs and startup journeymen, we understand the challenges faced by new businesses. Many customers come to us with little knowledge of the custom software development process. What they bring is an inspiring idea and a passion to succeed.</p>
    <p>Having achieved seed funding, businesses often seek to immediately employ software developers. Employee #1 for most startups is a CTO and this is a mistake that often leads to failure.</p>
    <p>It is unwise to dedicate seed money towards the salary of a few limited team members. Instead, many savvy businesses are turning to agencies such as Startup Heroes for <strong>software development services</strong>. You will achieve greater return by outsourcing your MVP to a reputable development team.</p>

    <h2>Why partner with Startup Heroes over other software companies?</h2>
    <p>Startup Heroes will be with you for the long haul. We'll meet you face-to-face and discuss your vision. Working to budget, we produce a high-quality MVP giving you a step towards further funding.</p>
    <p>We'll help you to identify and reach your target audience through effective marketing. Our "Heroes" even assist you in planning applications for crowdfunding and bridge rounds.</p>
    <p>When you partner with Startup Heroes, you get much more than a developer. Our <strong>software development outsourcing</strong> is based in the UK and second to none.</p>
    <p>Our aim is to see every product succeed. When the time is right, we'll work by your side to help build an in-house team to take the product forwards.</p>
